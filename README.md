## Hi there 👋
👋 Hey there! I'm Ashar Afrouz, a code wizard from Bengaluru, India. I make web apps faster, sleeker, and sometimes even magical. When I’m not battling bugs, you can find me trying to convince my code to deploy itself (still working on that)

💻 Skills: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and a sprinkle of Kubernetes for good luck.

🚀 Currently casting spells at Ather, where my code powers electric dreams.

🛠️ Fun fact: My commits have been known to cause spontaneous high-fives.
